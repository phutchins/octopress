= OWssh Documentation =
owssh is a Ruby gem that wraps awscli and allows you to quickly and easily list all stacks, stack details and ssh to nodes within a stack in OpsWorks. It provides a executable that gives you a command line tool called owssh and also provides a library that returns usable objects containing stack information.


== Prerequisites ==
+ awscli - http://aws.amazon.com/cli/

Installed automatically upon gem installation
+ command_line_reporter - https://rubygems.org/gems/command_line_reporter


== Installation ==
+ Ensure that you have the prerequisites installed
+ Install the owssh gem
    gem install owssh


== Configuration ==
+ Ensure that you have the awscli config file set up properly
    ~/.aws/config
+ Have your SSH key in the correct location and with the correct name and permissions (the name of this key file will be moved to a config file in the future)
    cp my_id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_dev
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa_dev


== Command Line Usage ==
owssh list - List all environments
owssh describe - Show details of hosts in all stacks
owssh describe [Stack Name] - Show details of a specific stack
owssh [Stack Name] [Hostname or Type] - SSH to a host in a stack
owssh [Stack Name] [Hostname or Type] "Your command here" - SSH to a host in a stack and run a command

 Type     - The type of host. I.E. rails-app, resque, etc...
 Hostname - The name of the host. I.E. rails-app1, resque1, etc...


== Library Usage ==


HASH get_stacks                      - Returns a hash with key of the Stack Name and Value of the Stack ID
HASH get_instances                   - Returns a hash with key of Hostname and value of a hash containing the following...
                                        "PUB_IP"  => Instance Public IP
                                        "PRIV_IP" => Instance Private IP
                                        "TYPE"    => Type of Instance
NIL  print_instances(instances_hash) - Prints a list of instances
NIL  print_stacks(stacks_hash)       - Prints a list of stacks
