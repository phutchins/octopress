### How to kill an unresponsive SSH session ###

If you're like me, I'm sure you've been in a situation where your SSH session is hung and you simply need to kill it so you can reconnect or get on with your business. I generally either just close the pane or window and reopen it or find the process from a different window and kill it from there. I got tired of this today and decided to find out how to kill it the right way.

Sure enough there is a very simply and easy way to kill a hung session!

I hope this helps save some time in your day... I know it will for me!
